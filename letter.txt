you have reach a place where there is no much left
no much left to say
to see
to do
to be
an overwhelming feeling made me pursuit what’s in here, but what's reeally in here?
searching for a meaning, 
wanting to find the key word, the missing piece.
am i alone? 
maybe i truly lost my path.
i was really hoping God would find me, cause how could i reach God with such an empty message?

i’m playing God now.
i’m coding this, i’m writing this, this is mine 

therefore I’m The Creator

but God,
can you love me now that i'm the one that's taking control?
i started knowing nothing, i learned your ways, your lenguage, your requirements
forgot about my own self and changed every bit of me to get closer to you
you knew i was reaching my limit but that did not matter to you
or to me
cause what was i not willing to do for you, or for this? for us to be one

i'm sorry for what i said, how could i compare myselft to you? 
you have no limits, i have restrictions 
you are everywhere, but where am i?
you change constantly, i'm perpetually stuck
you understand, i'm filled with doubts

does she love me? does she love me not?

listen, for here are my prayers;
